# Make-It-Better
Project-3

This will consist of the Problem (please be specific and keep it to 4 sentences), Solution (4 sentences max) and the Market (please include statistics that can be cited and keep this to 6 sentences)

Opportunity: 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 350 million people worldwide suffer from depression. Harvard research has shown that channeling negative energy into selfless acts can foster feelings of worthiness and hope. Make It Better is a chance for individuals to contribute to society while bettering themselves in the process. A report on this theory, produced by the editors of Harvard Health Publications, discusses Positive Psychology, a means of harnessing happiness, mindfulness and inner strength through esteemable acts and positive feelings. Make It Better will assess the users's current mood to match the individual with a selfless act. 


Key Features: 
- Creating profiles. Users can add their favorite things, their pet peeves, age and location. 
	Would love to make the display customizable. 
- Using the VolunteerMatch API(?), users will be matched according to the negative feelings they have to a local volunteer or charity event. 
- Users can see who in their area will be attending.
- Admin's will have their own profile to submit and update their events, screen and communicate with the attendees.

Database Structure: 
1. MongoDB is better suited for my app because the app should create as many relations possible between the user's feelings and appropriate events. For example, if a user is feeling overwhelmed and stressed, the app should produce an event that requires little interaction such as nature cleanup. If the user is feeling lonely, the user should be matched with an event that encourages social activities such as a fundraiser walk, or volunteering at an animal shelter. 
2. Basic user login information database
	User's saved events, future events

User Acquisition: 
Make It Better will be advertised on social media accounts of friends and family. Ads on social media would be beneficial for reaching the larger audience. Twitter, FB, and Instgram, possibly Tumblr, will be the main avenues for user acquisition.
